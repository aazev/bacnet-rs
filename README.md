# Rust BACNet stack

> **This is currently in a very early development phase. It's intended to work as a walking skeleton and evolve in a complete BACnet implementation**

Implementation of the BACnet (ASHRAE-135) standard in Rust.

Some of the goals are:

- Type safe BACnet telegram encoder and decoder
- Work with an asynchronous network stacks
- Work in a WebAssembly environment
